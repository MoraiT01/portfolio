This blade has a dark past.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.800
It has shed much innocent blood.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.300
Thank you.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.000
So...

00:26.400 --> 00:30.800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.500
I'm searching for someone.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.000
A dragon.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.
